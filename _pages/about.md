Hi there! Thanks for visiting my website. I am Abhinav. I am currently a second-year PhD student at Université de Montréal and part of [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/abhinav-gupta/){:target="\_blank"} working under the supervision of [Prof. Christopher Pal](https://mila.quebec/en/person/pal-christopher/){:target="\_blank"}. I am working on multi-agent communication focusing on analyzing compositionality in emergent languages. I am also interested in exploring Evolutionary Game Theory methods in non-cooperative games.

I received my Masters degree in Computer Science from New York University. I was part of the [CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/){:target="\_blank"} (Computational Intelligence, Learning, Vision, and Robotics) where I worked with [Prof. Kyunghyun Cho](http://www.kyunghyuncho.me/home){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Jason Weston](https://research.fb.com/people/weston-jason/){:target="\_blank"}. During my undergrad, I was an exchange student researcher at Carnegie Mellon University working with [Prof. Florian Metze](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html){:target="\_blank"} at the Language Technologies Institute. I also spent a semester at the National University of Singapore where I worked with [Prof. Khe Chai Sim](https://ai.google/research/people/105905/){:target="\_blank"} at the School of Computing.
