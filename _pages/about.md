Hi there! Thanks for visiting my website. I am Abhinav. I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at Université de Montréal and part of [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/abhinav-gupta/){:target="\_blank"} working under the supervision of [Prof. Christopher Pal](https://mila.quebec/en/person/pal-christopher/){:target="\_blank"}. I am working on multi-agent communication focusing on analyzing compositionality in emergent languages. I am also interested in exploring Evolutionary Game Theory methods in non-cooperative games.

I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the [​Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.courant.nyu.edu/) from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I was part of the [CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/){:target="\_blank"} (Computational Intelligence, Learning, Vision, and Robotics) where I worked with [Prof. Kyunghyun Cho](http://www.kyunghyuncho.me/home){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Jason Weston](https://research.fb.com/people/weston-jason/){:target="\_blank"}.  During summer 2017, I interned at [Adobe Research​](https://research.adobe.com/) in San Jose working with​ ​[Dr. Scott Cohen​](https://research.adobe.com/person/scott-cohen/) and​ [​Dr. Brian Price​](https://research.adobe.com/person/brian-price/).

During my undergrad, I was an exchange student researcher at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) working with [Prof. Florian Metze](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html){:target="\_blank"} at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/). I also spent a semester at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) where I worked with [Prof. Khe Chai Sim](https://ai.google/research/people/105905/){:target="\_blank"} at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science & Engineering from [​Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani​](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in summer 2016 where I worked with [Prof. Bharat Deshpande](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/bmd/profile). At the same time, I also graduated with a Master’s degree in Chemistry working with​ [​Prof. Anjan Chattopadhyay](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/anjan/profile)​ from the same institute.
