Hi there! I am Abhinav. I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at [Departement of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO)](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home) in [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en) and part of [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en){:target="\_blank"} working under the supervision of [Prof. Christopher Pal](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/pal-christopher-j){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Jakob Foerster](https://jakobfoerster.com){:target="\_blank"}. I am working on emergent languages in multi-agent communication.

I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the [​Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.courant.nyu.edu/) from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I was part of the [CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/){:target="\_blank"} (Computational Intelligence, Learning, Vision, and Robotics) where I worked with [Prof. Kyunghyun Cho](http://www.kyunghyuncho.me/home){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Jason Weston](https://research.fb.com/people/weston-jason){:target="\_blank"}.  During summer 2017, I interned at [Adobe Research​](https://research.adobe.com/) in San Jose working with​ ​[Dr. Scott Cohen​](https://research.adobe.com/person/scott-cohen) and​ [​Dr. Brian Price​](https://research.adobe.com/person/brian-price).

During my undergrad, I was an exchange student researcher at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) working with [Prof. Florian Metze](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html){:target="\_blank"} at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/). At CMU, I also collaborated with the [RoboTutor](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/robotutor/) team under led by Emeritus [Prof. Jack Mostow](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mostow) at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I spent my Fall 2015 semester at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) where I worked with [Prof. Khe Chai Sim](https://ai.google/research/people/105905/){:target="\_blank"} at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science & Engineering from [​Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani​](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in summer 2016 where I worked with [Prof. Bharat Deshpande](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/bmd/profile). At the same time, I also graduated with a Master’s degree in Chemistry working with​ [​Prof. Anjan Chattopadhyay](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/anjan/profile)​ from the same institute.
